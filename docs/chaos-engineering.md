# Chaos Engineering Guide

## Chaos Engineering for EKS Cluster Resilience

This guide provides comprehensive information on implementing and running chaos engineering experiments to ensure the resilience of your EKS clusters.

## Overview

Chaos engineering is the practice of intentionally introducing failures into your system to test its resilience and identify weaknesses before they become critical issues in production.

## Chaos Engineering Principles

### 1. Hypothesize about Steady State
- Define what "normal" behavior looks like
- Establish baseline metrics
- Set acceptable performance thresholds

### 2. Vary Real-World Events
- Network failures and partitions
- Pod and node failures
- Resource exhaustion
- Traffic spikes

### 3. Run Experiments in Production
- Start with minimal blast radius
- Gradually increase scope
- Monitor continuously

### 4. Automate Experiments
- Use continuous chaos engineering
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Implement safety controls

## Supported Chaos Experiments

### Pod-Level Chaos

#### Pod Failure
Randomly kill pods to test recovery mechanisms.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-failure-example
spec:
  action: pod-failure
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - default
    labelSelectors:
      "app": "nginx"
  scheduler:
    cron: "@every 5m"
```

#### Pod Kill
Simulate abrupt pod termination.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-kill-example
spec:
  action: pod-kill
  mode: fixed
  value: "2"
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - production
    labelSelectors:
      "tier": "frontend"
```

### Network Chaos

#### Network Partition
Simulate network partitions between services.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: NetworkChaos
metadata:
  name: network-partition
spec:
  action: partition
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - default
  direction: both
  target:
    mode: one
    selector:
      namespaces:
        - default
      labelSelectors:
        "app": "database"
```

#### Network Delay
Introduce network latency.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: NetworkChaos
metadata:
  name: network-delay
spec:
  action: delay
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - default
  delay:
    latency: "100ms"
    correlation: "100"
    jitter: "0ms"
```

### Resource Chaos

#### CPU Stress
Simulate high CPU usage.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: StressChaos
metadata:
  name: cpu-stress
spec:
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - default
  duration: "60s"
  stressors:
    cpu:
      workers: 2
      load: 80
```

#### Memory Stress
Simulate memory pressure.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: StressChaos
metadata:
  name: memory-stress
spec:
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - default
  duration: "30s"
  stressors:
    memory:
      workers: 1
      size: "512MB"
```

### Node-Level Chaos

#### Node Failure
Simulate node failures.

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: AWSChaos
metadata:
  name: node-stop
spec:
  action: ec2-stop
  duration: "5m"
  awsRegion: "us-west-2"
  ec2Instance: "i-1234567890abcdef0"
```

## Running Chaos Experiments

### Using Chaos Mesh

1. **Install Chaos Mesh**
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://mirrors.chaos-mesh.org/v2.5.1/install.sh
```

2. **Create Experiment**
```bash
kubectl apply -f chaos-experiments/pod-failure.yaml
```

3. **Monitor Experiment**
```bash
kubectl get podchaos
kubectl describe podchaos pod-failure-example
```

### Using CLI Tools

```bash
# List available experiments
chaos list experiments

# Run specific experiment
chaos run experiments/network-partition.yaml

# Check experiment status
chaos status experiment-id

# Stop experiment
chaos stop experiment-id
```

## Safety Controls

### Blast Radius Limitation
- Start with single pods/services
- Gradually increase scope
- Use canary deployments

### Time Boundaries
- Set maximum duration for experiments
- Implement automatic rollback
- Schedule experiments during maintenance windows

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Continuous monitoring during experiments
- Automated experiment termination on critical alerts
- Real-time dashboards for experiment impact

### Emergency Stop
- Quick experiment termination procedures
- Automated recovery mechanisms
- Escalation procedures

## Experiment Scenarios

### Application Resilience
- **Service Discovery Failure**: Remove service from discovery
- **Database Connection Loss**: Simulate database unavailability
- **API Gateway Failure**: Test fallback mechanisms

### Infrastructure Resilience
- **AZ Failure**: Simulate entire availability zone outage
- **Load Balancer Failure**: Test traffic routing resilience
- **Storage Failure**: Simulate persistent volume failures

### Operational Resilience
- **Deployment Failure**: Test rollback mechanisms
- **Configuration Drift**: Introduce configuration errors
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Test auto-scaling mechanisms

## Measuring Resilience

### Key Metrics
- **MTTR** (Mean Time To Recovery)
- **Error Rate** during experiments
- **Performance Degradation**
- **Recovery Success Rate**

### Success Criteria
- System continues to function
- Automated recovery works
- Acceptable performance maintained
- No data loss or corruption

## Best Practices

### Experiment Design
1. Start small and build confidence
2. Test one variable at a time
3. Have clear success criteria
4. Document all experiments

### Implementation
1. Use feature flags for experiment control
2. Implement circuit breakers
3. Monitor customer impact
4. Have rollback plans ready

### Culture
1. Embrace failure as learning opportunity
2. Share experiment results
3. Continuously improve based on findings
4. Train teams on chaos engineering

## Automation and CI/CD Integration

### Automated Experiments
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Chaos Engineering
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday 2 AM

jobs:
  chaos-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Chaos Experiments
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f chaos-experiments/
          sleep 300
          kubectl delete -f chaos-experiments/
```

Remember: Chaos engineering is not about breaking things randomly, but about learning how your system behaves under stress in a controlled manner. ðŸ”¥
